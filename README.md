hackernews cli
==========

###A command line tool to print out the latest posts on Hacker News to your terminal.

---

If you're anything like me, you visit Hacker news at least 4 times a day and you spend a lot of time in the terminal.

I usually open the Hacker News site in my browser and decide if any of the headlines catch my attention, I thought it would be cool if I could see a summary of the new featured posts in my terminal and only open them in a browser if I wanted to read them, so I made this simple tool.
